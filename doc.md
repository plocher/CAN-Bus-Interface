The CANBus Breadboard interface is a simple experimenter's interface
to the new, experimental CAN bus based NMRANet model railroad control
bus. It is similar to, and derived from the LEDuino, which (at this
writing) is no longer available.

## CANBus Breadboard Interface features

  * 5v power input taken from breadboard
  * A complete hardware interface to the industry standard CAN Bus
  * A single EuroStyle 4 pin commector (5v, H, L, Gnd)
  * Optional LED "RX", "TX", and "Interrupt" feedback
  * All MCP2551 communication pins available for connection to appropriate processor input and output pins.
